In an effort to transfer the library to the "pmnd.rs" organization, the API surface of the library will change in the following weeks. Information here could be out of date. For now the README.md on github is probably the safest source of the API
</Alert>

*Jongleur* is an animation and orchestration library for [three.js](https://threejs.org/) scenes as well as ordinary DOM objects. Helping you to *juggle* even highly complex animations. It is designed to work particularly well with React and the *fantastic* [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) library. The library can be used to create complex scroll based animations for beautiful landing pages.

For example, the scroll-based animation on the landing page of this documentation website is created using the library.

# Fundamentals

At the core of the library is the [ `orchestrate` ](./keyframes) function that defines how every (animated) element in the scene should behave. The input to the orchestration function is inspired by keyframe animation, as commonly used in other animation software. The resulting pre-processed animations are then [bound](./register) to React components as well as external objects. In contrast to typical animation software, the animations in *jongleur* are not only driven by time but can also be advanced by other forms of [progress](./progress). Progressing the animation though scrolling is supported by a set of utility components. Building beautiful landing pages has never been this easy!



# Features

Here are some of the main benefits of using *jongleur*: 

- 🔒 **Fully type safe**: Advanced typescript features ensure that animations are valid
- 🏎 **Performance optimized**: Demand-based frameloop is fully supported
- 📒 **Single source of truth**: Simple maintenance of large scenes
- ➡  **Progress abstraction**: Animations can be driven by scroll, time or other forms of input
- 🖱 **Scroll Utilities**: Create stunning scroll based interactive sites with a toolbox of React components

# Okay, now what?

Did that sound interesting to you? Great! Then let's get started...

If you are more of the learning by doing type checkout the [fast track](./fast-track) to get up and running as quickly as possible. Either way, it is best to check out all of the pages in the "Getting Started" Section to get a firm understanding of how the library works.

{/*
Otherwise, it's best to start with the definition of keyframes and the usage of the `orchestrate` function [here](./keyframes) as that is the most important part of any *jongleur* animation.
